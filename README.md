# SignalK Notes Plugin for OpenCPN

The **SignalK Notes Plugin** enhances OpenCPN by displaying **notes stored on a SignalK server directly on the nautical chart**. It is especially useful in setups where SignalK already acts as the central data hub.

The plugin shows notes as icons on the chart and updates them automatically whenever data on the SignalK server changes.

If there are too many notes in one place, they will be clustered (shown as a circle with the number of notes) and will only become visible at a smaller scale.

Several SignalK plugins (like ['Garmin Active Captain Resources'](https://activecaptain.garmin.com/en-US/map) or ['EuRIS (European River Information Services)'](https://www.eurisportal.eu/)) create notes and with this enhanced information for the skipper.

## Configuration

Open the settings dialog via the toolbar or via

Authentication in SignalK is not mandatory. If it is present: 1. Provider will be automatically deleted if the plugin has been deleted in SignalK or is no longer active 2. The name of the plugin and the description will be displayed instead of the plugin ID.

The request for authentication is made via the “SignalK authentication” button on the “Provider” tab.

The request should be approved in SignalK in the menu Security → Access requests with 'Permission' Admin and 'Authentication Timeout' NEVER

As soon as the request has been approved the valid connection is displayed in SignalK in the menu Security → Devices (with description 'OpenCPN SignalK Notes Plugin') and in the plugin on the tab "Provider".
